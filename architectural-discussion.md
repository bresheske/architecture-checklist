# Architectural Discussion
The purpose of this document is to identify a list of must-have, should-have, and could-have architectural features when building a new product.

_Note: This document is the opinion of the owner, and is always open to suggestions._

**TL;DR**: This page is more of a discussion as to the reasons why an item appears on the checklist. [The checklist itself is located here](./checklist.md).
